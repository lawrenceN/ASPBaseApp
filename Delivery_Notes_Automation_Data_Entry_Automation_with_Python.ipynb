You are given the the task to learn about Robotics Process Automation (RPA) from an external consultant hired by the company's board, and to implement a company-wide solutin that can automate the data entry of Delivery Notes (DNs). A DN is a document (usually with the format of an invoice) that describes the supply and receipt of goods."
